1. AgencySearch

- Overlay make cover the sidebar also
- Make it only cover the remaing space, no scroll bar if not needed. If lots of content then scroll bar appears
- Make it part of header (position fixed)
- Make sure it overlays over everything, except WorkHeader
- Need a skeleton for AgencySearch
- Make it work with fakedata (json file, not redux yet) and with existing styles

2. Modules

- Add Header, Aside, Main
- Css.gg - please use Arrow Left, Arrow Right
- Add same menu in Module Sidebar, as the one on Mobile Drawer
- Close Moduleaside when mobile drawer is avaible (1024px)
  ---- But need to have the option
